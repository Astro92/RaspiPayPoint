# RaspiPayPoint

 A simple payment terminal for BTC lightning transaction, powered by the LNPay.co service.
 
 Utilises a Raspberry Pi 3, running raspian, paired with a 320x480 TFT LCD screen to display the invoice for the chosen amount (in fiat).
 
 Can be used in connection with the maker platform IFTTT to provide notifications, and automations. 
 
 One example project I have used this for is to turn a light on (in seconds) for the number of satoshis payed.

I would like to expand this project by allowing it to run on start up.
